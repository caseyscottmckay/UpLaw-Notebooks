Reserve Bank Act 1959 (RBA Act).    Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 (FSSA).   Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act).   Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001 (FSCODA).   Financial Sector (Transfer and Restructure) Act 1999 (FSTRA).     Under these acts, the regulators have also set out the regulatory framework in prudential standards, practice guides and other guidelines.    Regulatory authorities\\n'\n",
      "b'In Austria What is the legal framework for banking regulation?\\tIn Austria Relevant sources of law governing banking regulation are:     Austrian federal laws.    EU regulations.    Regulations issued by the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA).   Binding Technical Standards (BTS) issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and EBA guidelines and recommendations.    FMA standards, circulars and other forms of soft law interpreting the main federal laws.      The primary sources of banking regulatory law are the Banking Act (Bankwesengesetz) and Regulation (EU) 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR)) together with Commission Delegated Regulations 2015/61/EU, 2015/62/EU and 2015/63/EU. The application of the CRR to credit institutions qualifying as CRR financial institutions is mandatory by virtue of a provision in the Banking Act.   The Banking Act governs the:     Licensing of credit institutions and financial institutions (Article 1).   Freedom of establishment and to provide services within the EEA (Article 9 and following).   Ownership requirements (Article 20 and following).   Rules on cover funds (Deckungsstock; Article 66 and following).    Contractual terms such as for savings deposits (Article 31 and following), certain value date provisions and banking secrecy (Article 38).      The CRR (including the related BTS) covers:     Minimum regulatory capital requirements and quality criteria for CET 1, AT 1 and T2 capital instruments.   Limits on large exposures, new liquidity rules and limits on qualifying holdings outside the financial sector.    Leverage ratios and disclosure requirements on credit institutions and investment firms.     Other relevant federal laws are the:     Building Society Act (Bausparkassengesetz (BSpG)) which regulates the operation and supervision of building savings bank (Bausparkassen).   Investment Fund Act (Investmentfondsgesetz) which regulates the operation and management of investment funds and the Austrian Real Estate Investment Fund Act (Immobilieninvestmentfondsgesetz).   Alternative Investment Fund Management Act (Alternative Investmentfonds Manager-Gesetz) which contains licensing and supervision of certain managers of collective investment undertakings.   Securities Supervision Act (Wertpapieraufsichtsgesetz) which sets out regulations on financial instruments trading and compliance.   Capital Market Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz (KMG)) which provides for rules on public offerings of securities and other capital investments.   Payment Services Act (Zahlungsdienstegesetz) which regulates the performance of payment services.   Financial Market Money Laundering Act (Finanzmarkt-Geldw\\xc3\\xa4schegesetz) which stipulates statutory due diligence obligations relating to money laundering and terrorism financing.    Capital Outflows Reporting Act (Kapitalabfluss-Meldegesetz) which imposes the obligation to report capital outflows to and inflows from Switzerland and Liechtenstein.   Account Register and Account Inspection Act (Kontenregister- und Konteneinschaugesetz) which introduced a central registry for bank accounts and deposits established with Austrian credit institutions.   In addition, there are a number of federal laws implementing EU Directives such as the:Remote Financial Services Act (Fernfinanzdienstleistungsgesetz);Financial Collateral Act (Finanzsicherheitengesetz);E-Money Act (E-Geld Gesetz); Consumer Loan Act (Verbraucherkreditgesetz); Mortgage Credit Act (Hypothekar- und Immobilienkreditgesetz);Consumer Payment Account Act (Verbraucherzahlungskontogesetz);Deposit Guarantee Schemes and Investor Compensation Act (Einlagensicherungs- und Anlegerentsch\\xc3\\xa4digungsgesetz (ESAEG));Common Reporting Standard Act (Gemeinsamer Meldestandard-Gesetz);Act on the Recovery and Resolution of Banks (Sanierungs- und Abwicklungsgesetz (BaSAG)).      Secondary and tertiary EU banking supervisory legislation has been implemented into Austrian law or applies directly, leaving little room for specific Austrian banking regulations.    Regulatory authorities\\n'\n",
      "b\"In Brazil What is the legal framework for banking regulation?\\tIn Brazil The main legislation governing the regulation and supervision of banks and other financial institutions is Law 4,595/1964, which sets out the legal framework for the financial system. It establishes the National Monetary Council (Conselho Monet\\xc3\\xa1rio Nacional) (CMN) as the authority responsible for money and credit policy and the Brazilian Central Bank (Banco Central do Brasil) (BCB) as the authority responsible for supervising financial institutions and issuing currency (see Question 2).   In addition, the Brazilian Government enacted law No. 13.506 dated 13 November 2017, known as the Financial Leniency Law, with rules applicable to administrative proceedings within BCB and the Brazilian Securities Commission (CVM). It is the main rule governing the imposition of penalties and fines to participants in the financial and capital markets. The Financial Leniency Law also introduces the possibility of executing leniency agreements with BCB and CVM, which gives individuals and/or legal entities the opportunity to plead guilty to obtain the a reduction in penalties.   There are also a number of rules and requirements issued by the CMN and the BCB, applicable to banks and other financial institutions, dealing with capital requirements, accounting procedures and managers' liabilities.

A bank is not permitted to carry on any business or exercise any power that is restricted by the Bank Act or to carry on or exercise any of its powers in a manner contrary to the Bank Act.    The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (CDIC Act) establishes a corporation for the insurance of deposits of banks and other subscribing institutions.   The Canadian Payments Act (CPA Act) sets out the legal framework for Payments Canada (formerly the Canadian Payments Association) Its mandate is to establish and operate national systems for clearing and settlement and other systems for financial and banking organisations.

      "b'In Chile What is the legal framework for banking regulation?\\t\"In Chile The Chilean banking system is based on the General Banking Act 1997. The General Banking Act, amended most recently in 2015, has expanded banks\\' traditional business. This has allowed them to engage in new activities, such as underwriting new issues of certain debt securities and creating subsidiaries for new related areas such as brokerage, equity underwriting, investment advice, mutual fund services, administration of investment funds, factoring, securitisation and financial leasing services.   The Superintendency of Banks and Financial Institutions (SBFI) and the Central Bank of Chile are the main regulators of the banking sector. The SBFI\\'s Updated Compilation of Rules and the Compendium of Financial Regulations issued by the Central Bank set most of the regulatory framework for banking activities in Chile.   Since banks must be incorporated as special corporations, Law No. 18,046 (Corporations Act) also applies to banks (with certain exceptions), mainly regarding corporate governance.    Law No. 18,010 (Money Lending Operations Act) governs the lending business in Chile, setting out what is understood as a money lending transaction, the rules governing accrual of interests and other matters.    Law No. 18,045 (Securities Market Act) governs the public offering of securities, secondary markets, stock exchanges, brokers and other matters. Since banks are expressly authorised to act as securities intermediaries, it applies to them while acting in this capacity.    The Consumer Protection Act also governs the provision of financial services to final consumers, and so applies to banks.    Law No 19,913 (Anti-Money Laundering Act) requires banks and others entities to report to the Financial Analysis Unit:     \"\"Suspicious transactions\"\" they are aware of.   Cash transactions exceeding US$10,000, on a semi-annual basis.   Documents and antecedents it requires to examine a previously reported suspicious transaction, or one it has detected.      Law No. 20,393 extends to legal entities liability for criminal wrongdoings related to money laundering, financing terrorism and bribery of civil servants (if such crimes are committed directly and immediately in the legal entity\\'s interest or for its benefit, by its owners or controllers).

      "b\"In Colombia What is the legal framework for banking regulation?\\tIn Colombia Financial regulation is set out in article 335 of the Colombian Constitution, which states that the financial, capital markets and insurance activities as well as any other activity related to the management of deposit-taking activities are activities of public interest and therefore can only be undertaken with prior and express authorisation from the government. The Colombian Constitution also states that the Colombian Congress must determine the way in which the government intervenes in the financial markets and regulates financial activities.   Subject to this constitutional framework, Colombian banking regulation is based on:     Laws enacted by the Colombian Congress that establish the general principles within which the government regulates the financial markets.   Decrees issued by the President and the Ministry of Finance that set out policy for the financial sector and the architecture of the financial system.    Resolutions and circular letters issued by the Superintendence of Finance that implement the technical aspects of the regulations issued by Congress and the Ministry of Finance.     In particular, the main sources of banking regulation law in Colombia are:     Law 45 of 1990, which establishes the government's powers to intervene, inspect, supervise and control the financial markets.   Law 1328 of 2009, which sets out the general principles for financial consumer protection.      Further to Law 45 of 1990, the Ministry of Finance issued Decree 663 of 1993, also referred to as the Organic Statute of the Financial System. The Organic Statute of the Financial System implements Law 45 of 1990 and establishes the general architecture of the Colombian financial system.    Decree 2555 of 2010 compiles all the financial markets decrees and unifies the financial regulation in a single instrument, establishing the general rules for performing financial activities in Colombia.    Under powers delegated by the Colombian government, the Superintendence of Finance issues resolutions and circular letters to implement the technical aspects of financial regulation. The main instruments issued by the Superintendence of Finance are the:     Basic Legal Resolution (Circular Externa 029 of 2014), which sets out general instructions applicable to all institutions supervised by the Superintendence of Finance.   Basic Financial and Accounting Resolution (Circular Externa 100 of 1995), which establishes the accounting principles and policies applicable to supervised institutions.

      "b'In Cyprus What is the legal framework for banking regulation?\\tIn Cyprus The main legislation relating to banking regulation in Cyprus is the Business of Credit Institutions Laws of 1997 to 2018 (Law No. 66(I)/1997) (Credit Business Law) which implements various EU Directives including Directive 2013/36/EU on capital requirements (Capital Requirements Directive IV).   The Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) has issued a number of directives under the Credit Business Law.   There are also various EU regulations (which have direct effect in Cyprus) dealing with banking regulation including Regulation (EU) 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (Capital Requirements Regulation).   The provision of payment services and electronic money services is regulated separately by legislation implementing relevant EU directives, namely the Law on Electronic Money (Law No. 81(I)/2012) (as amended) and the Law on the Provision and Use of Payment Services and Access to Payment Systems (Law No. 31(I)/2018).    Broadly, banks authorised under the Credit Business Law or passported into Cyprus can provide payment services and electronic money services without the need for a separate licence.     Regulatory authorities\\n'\n",
      "b'In Denmark What is the legal framework for banking regulation?\\tIn Denmark The overall regulation of financial institutions and conduct of financial business is in the Financial Business Act (Consolidation Act No. 1140 of 26 September 2017). This regulates the activities, licensing requirements, duties and responsibilities of financial institutions, including banks, mortgage credit institutions, insurance companies and investment firms. The Financial Business Act also provides the legal framework for the supervision of compliance by the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA).    The Financial Business Act is to a large extent harmonised with EU legislation and implements various EU directives, such as Directive 2013/36/EU on capital requirements (Capital Requirements Directive IV), and Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II). EU regulations, such as Regulation (EU) 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (Capital Requirements Regulation), are directly applicable.    Numerous executive orders and guidelines have been issued under the Financial Business Act. These include the requirements as to fit and proper, remuneration, risk labelling of investment products, and good business practices for financial institutions.    Banks founded as limited liability companies are also subject to the Companies Act, to the extent it does not conflict with the Financial Business Act.    Directive 2014/59/EU on Bank Recovery and Resolution (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive) has been implemented into Danish law through a new act on the recovery and resolution of Danish banks, mortgage credit institutions and certain investment firms (see Question 24).

Act on Bondholder Representatives (574/2017)..     The following apply to banks to the extent that they provide investment services, deal in or otherwise trade in securities or other financial instruments:     Act on Investment Firms (747/2012).   Securities Markets Act (746/2012).   Act on Trading in Financial Instruments (1070/2017)     These Acts apply on resolution actions taken in respect of credit institutions and implement Directive 2014/59/EU on resolution of credit institutions and certain investment firms and Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 establishing uniform rules and procedure for the resolution of credit institutions:     Act on the Financial Stability Authority (1195/2014).
